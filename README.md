# Retinal-disease-detection

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify different types of eye diseases, such as **Cataract**, **Diabetic Retinopathy**, **Glaucoma**, and **Normal** using Resnet based on retinal images.

## Project Overview

The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify retinal images into one of the four categories:

1. **Cataract**
2. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
3. **Glaucoma**
4. **Normal**

### Key Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and transforming image data.
   - Applying necessary augmentation techniques for better generalization.
2. **Model Development**: 
   - Using a pre-trained ResNet50 model with fine-tuning to classify eye diseases.
3. **Model Training**: 
   - Training the model with the dataset, monitoring loss and accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Result**: 
   - Analyzing the model's predictions and visualizing the classification results.
